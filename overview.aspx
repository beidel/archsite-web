                <h3>Subscriber View</h3>
                <p>The Subscriber level view provides data and support to state and local professionals who need access for planning and stewardship activities, such as OCRM permits. The Subscriber View provides access to archaeological site data and restricted National Register properties in addition to the non-restricted data layers available in the Public Viewer. Access to this view requires a vetting procedure to ensure that their request for access of site location data is appropriate. The vetting procedure is in place to protect the resources represented in ArchSite, which are both vulnerable and non-renewable.</p>

                <p>The Subscriber View also includes additional tools for searching the database and provides an export functionality that allows users to obtain digital shapefiles from all of the data layers available with the annual subscription.</p>
                <p>The Subscriber View is password protected and only available to users who sign a <a href="http://archsite.cas.sc.edu/sciaainfo/ArchSite%20Subscription%20Request%20Form%20&%20License%20Agreement2.pdf">license agreement</a> and pay a subscription fee.</p>
